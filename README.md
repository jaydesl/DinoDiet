# DinoDiet

**Principal Investigator:** Dr. Geller[^1]

## Project Description

This project[^1] aims to analyse the dietary habits of dinosaurs during 
the late Cretaceous period. We will be focusing on the differences
between herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs.

> [!NOTE]
> The project will include data collection, analysis, and visualisation of the findings.

## Sections

- [Data Collection](#data-collection)
- [Data Analysis](#data-analysis)
- [Data Visualisation](#data-visualisation)
- [Conclusion](#conclusion)

A simple plan for progressing through the technical stages of the project
is shown below:

### Data Collection

We will be gathering data from various sources, including fossil records,
scientific literature, and online databases. We've listed some key sources
below, check them out!

1. [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org)
2. [The Fossil Forum](https://www.thefossilforum.com/)
4. [Research articles from the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ujvp20/current)

### Data Analysis

The data will be analysed using statistical methods to identify patterns
and trends in the dietary habits of dinosaurs. We will be comparing the
diets of herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs to understand their food
preferences and ecological roles.

We will be using R programming for our data analysis. Here is a sample
of how we will load the data into R:

```r
library(tidyverse) # Load the necessary libs

dino_data <- read_csv("dino_data.csv") # Read the data
```

### Data Visualisation

We will create graphs and charts to visualise the findings from our analysis.
This will help us better understand the relationships between different dinosaur
species and their diets. For instance, we will include visualisations such as pie
charts for proportions of herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs, and bar graphs
for the comparison of average body sizes.

> [!WARNING]
> Dinosaur images may be frightening.

An example of a dinosaur image we will use for reference in our
visualisations can be found below:

### Conclusion

The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the dietary habits
of dinosaurs during the late Cretaceous period. The findings from this research
could provide insights into the evolution and ecology of these fascinating creatures
and potentially reveal new information about their extinction event.

## Contributor Reference

### Hunger Factor :chart_with_upwards_trend:

The Hunger Factor (HF) is an important metric in our work. We calculate it
with the following equation:

$HF = \sqrt(Food Eaten^2)$

### DinoSoft Bugs :bug:

When calculating large HF scores for dinosaurs, the DinoSoft software may crash.

### Dino Diets :t-rex:

For reference, here is a summary of the diets and primary food sources
of some well-known dinosaur species:

| Dinosaur Species | Diet      | Primary Food Sources |
|------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Triceratops      | Herbivore | Ferns, cycads, and horsetails |
| Tyrannosaurus    | Carnivore | Triceratops, Edmontosaurus |
| Stegosaurus      | Herbivore | Ferns, mosses, and cycads |
| Velociraptor     | Carnivore | Small herbivorous dinosaurs |
| Brachiosaurus    | Herbivore | High tree foliage, such as conifers |
| Spinosaurus      | Carnivore | Fish, small to medium-sized dinosaurs |
| Oviraptor        | Omnivore  | Eggs, plants, small animals |

More widely, we estimate the following distribution of dinosaur diets:

```mermaid
pie title Dino Diet Distribution
    "Herbivore" : 65
    "Carnivore" : 25
    "Omnivore" : 10
```
